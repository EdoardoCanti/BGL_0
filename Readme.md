#Fundamentals of Boost Graph Library :octocat:

- Definition of **undirected graph** using **adjacency list**. Definition of vertices and edges. Use of *vertex iterators* and *adjacency iterators*. Use of *boost::tie()* function. Insert a new vertex, and eventually edges, on a built graph.

- Understanding **directional graph**. Understanding **in-edges** and **out-edges iterators**. Solved issue using in-edges on a directional graph. Implementation of a **bidirectional graph**.

- Learn **property-maps**. Implementation of **weighted graph**. Printing out weights for each edge.

- **Classes instances used as graph vertices**. Printing their own values with *graph_name[pointer_vertex_iterator]*.
